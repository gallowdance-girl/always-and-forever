        "You are the peace after every storm I’ve faced.",
        "Your presence is my sanctuary in the vastness of space.",
        "Even the Force trembles in reverence to your grace.",
        "Your love is the light that guides me through the darkness.",
        "With you, every path becomes the right one.",
        "The Council would approve — because my heart has chosen you.",
        "Even Yoda would say, ‘Truly in love, I am.’",
        "I sense you through the Force even when you're galaxies away.",
		"Your love is my center, my calm, my clarity.",

		"You're the reason I return from every mission.",
		"Your love is stronger than any Force bond — it's fate.",
		"You're not my weakness. You are my sacred strength.",
		"The stars can fall, but I will remain so long as you’re with me.",
		"I’ve walked through the Dark — but your love is my Light.",
		"Even without the Force, I'd still find you in every lifetime.",
		"Your love is my meditation, my healing, my sanctuary.",
		"If Jedi must not form attachments, then I have broken every rule — and I do not regret it.",
		"I would silence a galaxy for one moment of peace with you.",

		"You are the path, the reason, the truth I’ve been seeking.",
		"Even the Force is silent in awe of what we share.",
		"I serve peace and justice — but I live for your smile.",
		"My saber defends the galaxy — my heart defends you.",
		"You bring balance to every chaos inside me.",
		"You're the reason I choose compassion over control.",

		"You gave me the courage to be more than just a guardian.",
		"You make the Temple feel like home, no matter where we are.",
		"You're the voice I listen for through the noise of battle.",
		"If I could hold anything forever, it would be the memory of your touch.",
		"I may be trained for peace — but with you, I feel it.",
		"Even if the Council disapproved, I would still choose you.",
		"I never believed in fate — until I met you and everything aligned.",
		"You turn every exile into an adventure, every silence into a lullaby.",
		"You are the balance I never knew I was missing.",
		"Let the stars argue fate — I’ve already found mine in you.",
		"You are my peace after the storm, my breath after the battle.",
		"I would defend your soul like I would defend the galaxy—without hesitation.",
		"You are the guiding light through all my trials.",
		"With you, I finally understand what it means to be whole.",
		"You are the holocron I never want to stop reading.",
		"You're the reason I believe love can exist with honor, not in spite of it.",
		"You make the Force feel personal, like it was created to connect us.",
		"Even in stillness, your presence hums through me like a living melody.",
		"I don’t need a vision to see it clearly — you are my future.",
		"If the galaxy burns, let me burn holding you.",
		"I’d break my silence if it meant saying your name one last time.",
		"You're not just in my life — you are my life.",
		"I once sought peace. Now I’ve found it — in you.",
		"You're the destiny that makes every trial worth enduring.",
		"You’ve become the gravity to my soul — steady, strong, inescapable.",
		"If love is a disturbance in the Force, then I hope I’m never balanced again.",
		"You are the only light I’d follow into any darkness.",
		"I'd face every Sith in the galaxy if it meant one more day with you.",
		"I no longer walk alone. I walk with your love wrapped around me like a robe.",
		"You are my truth, my purpose, and my peace."
