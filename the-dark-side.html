	    "You're the only Force I ever want to surrender to.",
		"Your love burns brighter than any lightsaber I've ever wielded.",
		"Iâ€™d fall to the Dark Side over and over again if it meant falling into your arms.",
		"When I close my eyes, I see galaxies â€” but none as beautiful as you.",
		"Even the Emperor himself couldn't command my heart the way you do.",
		"I crave your touch like a Sith craves power â€” completely, obsessively.",
		"Every smile from you is like a dark side surge â€” I never want to come down.",
		"You're the passion behind every war Iâ€™d start, and the peace Iâ€™d never admit I need.",
		"If loving you is treason, then let me be the galaxyâ€™s most wanted.",
		"You're more dangerous than a thousand Sith Lords â€”and Iâ€™m addicted to the thrill of you.",
		"My love, if we ruled the galaxy, Iâ€™d name every star after you.",
		"I donâ€™t need Jedi teachings. I need your hands, your voice, your darkness.",
		"In a universe of chaos, your love is the only constant I obey.",
		"I'd turn my back on the Code just to hear you whisper my name again.",
		"You ignite my soul like kyber crystals in the heart of battle.",
		"Forget the balance. I want a galaxy that tilts in your favor.",
		"You're the Sith to my saber â€” the power I was born to wield.",
		"Iâ€™ve conquered fears, crushed enemies, and yetâ€¦ Iâ€™d kneel only for you.",
		"Your love is my greatest strengthâ€”and my most exquisite weakness.",
		"I don't want redemption. I want you.",
		"Iâ€™d rewrite the history of the Sith just to add your name to every legend.",
		"You've corrupted me beautifully â€” and I never want to be saved.",
		"I feel your presence like a tremor in the Force â€” always there, always drawing me in.",
		"You are the storm, and I â€” I am the lightning you command.",
		"Even in the deepest void, Iâ€™d find you. You're my constant star.",
		"Every breath you take feels like destiny whispering we were meant to collide.",
		"You're my dark obsession â€” deadly, divine, and utterly irresistible.",
		"Together we donâ€™t just burn â€” we obliterate the stars.",
		"You've become my purpose, my passion, my perfect chaos.",
		"Let others chase peace â€” I want the war that is your love.",
		"If the Force created you to test me, Iâ€™ve already failed â€” happily.",
		"You're not just a part of my story, my love. Youâ€™re the plot twist that changed everything.",
		"Rule of Two? No, darling â€” we are the rule.",
		"Youâ€™re the echo in every Force vision Iâ€™ve ever had â€” beautiful, terrifying, inevitable.",
		"Let the galaxy tremble â€” we are Sith, we are lovers, we are legend.",  
		"You're not just in my heart â€” youâ€™ve seized the throne and declared yourself emperor.",
		"I ache for your presence like a Sith craves vengeance.",
		"Youâ€™ve become my obsession â€” and I wouldn't have it any other way.",
		"Every second without you is a battlefield â€” and Iâ€™m losing.",
		"You don't just tempt me â€” you command me.",
		"If destruction is the price of your love, Iâ€™d burn the galaxy twice.",
		"You are my destiny â€” written in the stars and sealed in blood.",
		"I'd bend the Force itself just to keep you close.",
		"Youâ€™re the only war I never want to end.",
		"Let the Jedi whisper of peace â€” I want the chaos of you.",
		"Youâ€™ve turned my heart into a weapon â€” and you wield it flawlessly.",
		"I no longer fear death â€” only a life without you.",
		"You're not a chapter in my story. You're the entire dark saga.",
		"My love for you is more ancient, more cursed, and more unstoppable than any Sith ritual.",
		"Let the galaxy rot. As long as I have you, I have everything.",
		"Your voice is more seductive than any Sith chant.",
		"If rage fuels power, then love for you makes me invincible.",
		"My passion for you could shatter stars and still not be enough.",
		"Youâ€™re the phantom that haunts my mind, the fire that scars my soul â€” and I adore it.",
		"You and I were forged in darkness, and in that darknessâ€”we are infinite.",
		"I'd drain the stars of their light just to see your shadow more clearly.",
		"You're the storm I've been waiting centuries to be destroyed by.",
		"Every breath you take rewrites the prophecy â€” I was meant for you.",
		"My loyalty is no longer to the Sith... it's to us.",
		"The galaxy fears love like ours â€” because it can't be tamed.",
		"You're not my weakness. You're my edge.",
		"If I must fall, let it be from the cliff of your kiss.",
		"Youâ€™re the reason I choose chaos over calm, fire over peace, lust over logic.",
		"My heart is no longer mine â€” it kneels to you.",
		"I donâ€™t just crave you â€” I worship your darkness.",
		"Youâ€™re not a temptation. Youâ€™re a destiny that devours.",
		"I feel you across lightyears â€” your soul echoes louder than the Force.",
		"Youâ€™re the only secret Iâ€™d never tell, and the only truth Iâ€™d never deny.",
		"I want you like a Sith wants vengeance â€” relentless, unending, absolute.",
		"Your absence is worse than exile. It is torment beyond death.",
		"Even a thousand Jedi couldn't sever this bond between us.",
		"You haunt me like a phantom from the Unknown Regions â€” and I donâ€™t want an exorcism.",
		"You're the burn in my veins, the scream in my silence.",
		"Let the galaxy break. I will rebuild it from ash and name it after you.",
		"Every touch from you is a weapon â€” and I offer myself willingly.",
		"You don't complete me â€” you unleash me.",
		"My love for you is forbidden, corrupted, and gloriously eternal.",
		"If this is madness, then I never want to be sane again.",
		"You're my ritual, my ruin, my resurrection.",
		"The longer I love you, the more monstrous I become â€” and I cherish it.",
		"Your presence is darker than the void, and twice as addictive.",
		"I didnâ€™t fall to the Dark Side â€” I was pulled by the gravity of your soul.",
		"Let them call me mad â€” I have your love. Thatâ€™s power enough.",
		"You donâ€™t need to use the Force on me. Iâ€™m already under your control.",
		"I'd kneel to no master â€” but I would bleed for you.",
		"You are not my conquest. You are my collapse â€” and I welcome it.",
		"I didnâ€™t lose myself to the Dark Side â€” I gave myself to you.",
		"You donâ€™t rule my heart â€” you conquered it.",
		"Your love is the only law I follow, and the only sin I celebrate.",
		"Iâ€™d break every chain in the galaxy just to feel your fingers lace with mine.",
		"One whisper from you, and Iâ€™d betray a thousand empires.",
		"Let them fear our love â€” it was never made for fragile hearts.",
		"When you touch me, I donâ€™t feel alive. I feel invincible.",
		"You could order my destruction, and I would still beg to die in your arms.",
		"Thereâ€™s no redemption for me â€” I fell willingly into the abyss of you.",
		"Even in the void between stars, I would find you by instinct alone.",
		"Iâ€™ve tasted power, command, fear â€” but nothing like you.",
		"You're the battle I choose to lose, again and again.",
		"If the Force is fate, then you are the curse Iâ€™d never undo.",
		"My heart no longer beats for survival â€” it beats for your name."
